      <h1>Before I began to read the articles “What is code”, I think code is a language of computers. The computer system could be controlled by code? I never learn to code before I came to college, but nowadays many young people learn to code when they are elementary school students. I am thinking about why we learn to code from such young ages. As the authors say, computers are for people, and do we have to constantly develop and evolve to make it convenient for us?
      <br>This article describes how the code is created and works and also how software development. One of the interesting Ideas I take from the article is; I was amazed at the fact that the keyboard also works by coding and each word has its own key number. I wonder how code works with these keyboard for all different languages?
      <br>
      After I read this article I wonder how this industry will shift in the future. Because the code is a kind of language so it will change, add and develop more and more in the future.
      <br>
      The second article “What Screen Want” focuses on the visual character of web design. Also, it discusses differences of the flat and skeuomorph design in the importance of the web design field.

      <h2>
      My first reaction on seeing this website was it’s hard to read it. I don’t understand this web site hierarchy, blue font, the next button, and use of another language such as Russian. When I read the first page, I thought this was one-page reading because I could not find the next button for forwarding to the next page. Definitely, it was a different style of the web in mid-1990, but still, I can not believe that it existed at the time. I enjoyed seeing the style of earlier elements like icons, link, frame. I hear that fashion trends are turning around, so I wonder if the Web design trend also will turn around and follow the previous design element like fashion. Of course, it is a sophisticated way, but it is based on old things.
      <br>
      The compared to Olia Lialina’s Vernacular Web1 article, this has an excellent hierarchy to read for viewers; narrow paragraphs, interspersing images and text, larger and heavy font, icon, and comment on the bottom, the margin between paragraphs, graphic images and wider margin. When I think about what is web design, I am not sure; is it more relative to computer science or graphic design fields? I know the coding is more based on computer code. It is interesting because code makes a beautiful design structure, function, and elements like an artist. Web coding is involved in creativity and technology as various meaningful media.

      <h3>During last semester GD workshop, my professor asked me "Do you guys think about how much DNA is left on this design building for a day? And also how much information are we leaving a trace on the Internet? Are we afraid that the company has our information as well as the fingerprints and face-IDs that is provided to Apple?" After his questions, I got a shock because I never think about providing our information like fingerprints and face-ID to Apple, I only think it is advantageous to us using a phone in everyday life. I can't imagine how much my information exists on the internet. In the digital age, I feel that I give up my privacy to spread my personal information. I feel like we are living in a world like the 21st century's The Truman Show. My friend, who is working in the marketing field, explained to me how they collect data for advertisements. The article describes that "personal information is the lifeblood of the new economy: companies collect their users’ data to sell it to advertisers and generate revenue." Through entrepreneurial spirit like Facebook, the company could collect data and give new opportunities to users as capitalism, how can we say it is good or bad?  We will not be able to answer this dichotomous question in a simple way.
      <br>
      My first impression of this article is Wow, they have many images to describe the concept of internet interaction, pictures help to understand easily, but sometimes it is hard to read background texts. I have found that the Internet seems to be one, but it is made up of a very complex concept. I can't imagine how big the internet is.

      <h4>
        Through the development of the Internet, we have convenience and enjoyment, but the world of the Internet is too complicated and problematic. The article tells audiences about advertisements, big commercial companies, and privacy. I think privacy is the biggest problem. Google, Netflix, Facebook, and Instagram all exist for our convenience, but in reality, they are collecting and analyzing our information. We already know that our personal information is sprinkled on the Internet world. The Internet is not a nation, how can all countries control these privacy problems? I am wondering how many people from various countries log into websites created in various countries, therefore how should we regulate and protect them in the Internet world which is not a nation? I agree with the number 87: “With a probability approaching absolute certainty, we are going to be sorry we didn’t do more to keep data out of the hands of our governments and corporate overlords.” We should monitor periodically to ensure that the companies or countries that have our information try to keep them safe. I wonder how do we balance access vs. influence?
